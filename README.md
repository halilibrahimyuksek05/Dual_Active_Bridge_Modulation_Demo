# Dual Active Bridge Modulation Demo

[![View <File Exchange Title> on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/####-file-exchange-title)  

This is a collection of basic dual active bridge implementations that explore single phase modulation,
trapezoidal and triangular modulation, as well as a three phase dual active bridge.

## Setup 
double click on DAB.prj

The project will automatically open a live script that guides you to the 
different models and the modulation app.  If this does not happen, navigate
to the utilities folder and open Intro.mlx.
